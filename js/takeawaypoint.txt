DAY 2

Javascript (Defination) :
-> Synchronous
-> Single Threaded
-> Blocking Language
-> Case Sensitive
-> Dynamic language

Data Types in Javascript
-> Number  : 1,2,3
-> Boolean : true,false
-> String  : alphabets, symbols, [strings are wrapped in double quote eg. "Dipesh"]
             alphabets-> "a" , "Dipesh"
             "123" is also a string as it is wrapped by double quote.

Variable Defination is done by using "let". For constant "const" is used.

DAY 3

Conversion
-> STRING Conversion : String() is used. [In terminal string is always shown in white colour]
   1 --> "1"
   true --> "true" and false --> "false"
   CODE: string(1)="1",string(true)

-> Only number string can be converted into string.

-->To Boolean Conversion
   All Empty Are False

->A FUNCTION IS USELESS IF IT IS NOT CALLED

DAY 4
default value
concept of return value

-> js is called dynamic language because a variable can store different data type at different point(time)
-> we can call variable inside the backtick(`) but it is not possible inside single quote or double quote
