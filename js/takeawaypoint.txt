DAY 2

Javascript (Defination) :
-> Synchronous
-> Single Threaded
-> Blocking Language
-> Case Sensitive
-> Dynamic language

Data Types in Javascript
-> Number  : 1,2,3
-> Boolean : true,false
-> String  : alphabets, symbols, [strings are wrapped in double quote eg. "Dipesh"]
             alphabets-> "a" , "Nikita"
             "123" is also a string as it is wrapped by double quote.

Variable Defination is done by using "let". For constant "const" is used.

DAY 3

Conversion
-> STRING Conversion : String() is used. [In terminal string is always shown in white colour]
   1 --> "1"
   true --> "true" and false --> "false"
   CODE: string(1)="1",string(true)

-> Only number string can be converted into string.

-->To Boolean Conversion
   All Empty Are False

->A FUNCTION IS USELESS IF IT IS NOT CALLED

DAY 4/5
default value
concept of return value
 -> default function will return undefined value
-> js is called dynamic language because a variable can store different data type at different point(time)
-> we can call variable inside the backtick(`) but it is not possible inside single quote or double quote

DAY 6
ARRAY
syntax let names = ["nikita", "ram", "hari"]
collection of multiple value

object -> physical instance of class
array stores collection of value
where as
object store collection of value with information

DAY 7
-> for each 
syntax
arl.forEach() =>{      //Always first write syntax then add value 
}

->string wil always win during any operation
1 + "1" = "11"
"a"+ "b"= "ab"

-> forEach doesnot produce any data
-> string => array // Conversion
-> array => string // conversion

DAY 8 

If input and output are array with same length always use map
filter
-> we can use filter when we have output from the same array input 
eg [1, 2, 3] = [2, 3]
[1, 3, 10] = [1]
[1, 3, 10] = [1, 9] // we cannot use filter here 
-> only can return true or false 

->reverse
reverse method change original value as well as give new value

DAY 9
-> arrayObject
